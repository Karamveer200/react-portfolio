      "As a backend developer, working with Karamveer to integrate the work I've done with all the work he does in the frontend is a very efficient and straightforward process. He's always very clear with what is needed from me, but can also be flexible and adapt to whatever requirements I bring to him. He's hard-working and never falls behind, but also has a sense of humor and friendliness that makes him easy to work with. And of course, all of the Javascript he does for the frontend works like a charm and looks great every time",
